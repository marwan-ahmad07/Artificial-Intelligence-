"""Heuristic scoring for Connect 4 positions.

The heuristic is intentionally stronger than a simple piece-counting model.
It rewards actual connect-fours, near-complete threats, and control of the
center column while also penalizing the opponent's opportunities.

============ Heuristic Overview - How We Score a Board Position ============

The heuristic is a compact approximation of the full game. It answers:
is this position good for the AI or good for the opponent, and by how much?

In Minimax, once we reach the allowed depth limit, we evaluate the position
using this heuristic instead of playing to the very end.
Each position gets a score:
    - positive = good for the AI
    - negative = good for the opponent
    - 0 = neutral

This heuristic focuses on:
1. connect-4 patterns: strongest pattern and highest value
2. open-three patterns: dangerous threat that can win in one move
3. open-two patterns: medium threat and foundation for stronger threats
4. center control: center column usually gives better strategic options
